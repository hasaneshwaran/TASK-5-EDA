# Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The objective of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using statistical and visual exploration techniques.

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** Titanic Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)
- **Description:** Dataset containing passenger details such as age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

---

## Task Workflow

1. Imported libraries and dataset
2. Performed data cleaning
   - Checked null values and handled them appropriately
3. Performed statistical analysis
   - Used `.describe()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()` to understand data distribution
4. Visualized data
   - Histograms to check distributions
   - Boxplots to detect outliers
   - Pairplots to see relationships
   - Heatmap to check correlations
   - Scatterplots for bivariate analysis
5. Wrote observations for each plot
6. Summarized key insights

---

## Outcome
- Understood how to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in data
- Practiced important EDA visualizations and statistical summaries

---

## Key Learnings
- Importance of EDA before model building
- Identifying and handling missing values
- Analyzing feature correlations
- Summarizing findings effectively for stakeholders

---

## Files Included
- `task5_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full EDA
- `report.pdf` – PDF report summarizing EDA findings
- `train.csv` – Dataset used

---

## Submission
Submitted as part of Data Analyst Internship – Task 5.
